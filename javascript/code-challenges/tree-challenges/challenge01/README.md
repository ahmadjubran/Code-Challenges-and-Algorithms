# Tree:

## Challenge01 - Construct BT from Preorder & Inorder:

<h1>Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal</h1>

<p>Given two integer arrays <code>preorder</code> and <code>inorder</code> where <code>preorder</code> is the preorder traversal of a binary tree and <code>inorder</code> is the inorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return <em>the binary tree</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="../../../assets/tree/tree-01-ex1.jpg" style="width: 300px;height: 215px;">
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> preorder = [3,9,20,15,7], inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
<strong>Output:</strong> [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> preorder = [-1], inorder = [-1]
<strong>Output:</strong> [-1]
</pre>



## Instruction:

### Language: `JavaScript`:

* Create a branch called `tree_construct-BT`.
* Run this command to pull the code challenge question: `npm run pull-challenge tree 01`
* Navigate to the challenge folder: `code-challenges/tree/challenge01`
* Write your solution in `challenge01.js` file.
* Write your tests in `challenges01.test.js` file.
* Document your work along with an image of your whiteboard in the `whiteboard.md` file.
* To run your test: `npm test`


## Language: `Python`:

* Create a branch called `tree_construct-BT`.
* Run this command to pull the code challenge question: `python pull.py tree 01`
* Navigate to the challenge folder: `code_challenges/tree/challenge01`
* Write your solution in `challenge01.py` file.
* Write your tests in `test_challenges01.py` file.
* Document your work along with an image of your whiteboard in the `whiteboard.md` file.
* To run your test: `pytest`


## Submission:
* ACP your work once you are done.
* Create a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch
* Copy the link to your open pull request and paste it into the assignment submission field.
* Leave a description of how long this assignment took you in the comments box.
* Add any additional comments to your grader about your process or any difficulties you may have had with the assignment.
* Merge your branch into main, and delete your branch (don't worry, the PR link will still work).
