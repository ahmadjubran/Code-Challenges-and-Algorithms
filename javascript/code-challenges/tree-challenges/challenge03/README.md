# Tree:

## Challenge03 - Convert Sorted Array to BST:

<p>Given an integer array <code>nums</code>, convert <em>it to a <strong>height-balanced</strong> binary search tree</em>.</p>

<p>A <strong>height-balanced</strong> binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="../../../assets/tree/tree-03-ex1.jpg" style="width: 300px;height: 215px;">
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [0,-3,-10,5,9]
<strong>Output:</strong> [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="../../../assets/tree/tree-03-ex2.jpg" style="width: 300px;height: 215px;">
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [3,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> [3,1]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> [1,null,3] and [3,1] are both height-balanced BSTs.
</pre>

## Instruction:

### Language: `JavaScript`:

* Create a branch called `tree_convert_to_BST`.
* Run this command to pull the code challenge question: `npm run pull-challenge tree 03`
* Navigate to the challenge folder: `code-challenges/tree/challenge03`
* Write your solution in `challenge03.js` file.
* Write your tests in `challenges03.test.js` file.
* Document your work along with an image of your whiteboard in the `whiteboard.md` file.
* To run your test: `npm test`


## Language: `Python`:

* Create a branch called `tree_convert_to_BST`.
* Run this command to pull the code challenge question: `python pull.py tree 03`
* Navigate to the challenge folder: `code_challenges/tree/challenge03`
* Write your solution in `challenge03.py` file.
* Write your tests in `test_challenges03.py` file.
* Document your work along with an image of your whiteboard in the `whiteboard.md` file.
* To run your test: `pytest`


## Submission:
* ACP your work once you are done.
* Create a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch
* Copy the link to your open pull request and paste it into the assignment submission field.
* Leave a description of how long this assignment took you in the comments box.
* Add any additional comments to your grader about your process or any difficulties you may have had with the assignment.
* Merge your branch into main, and delete your branch (don't worry, the PR link will still work).
