# Tree:

## Challenge02 - Breadth First Traversal:

<p>Given the roots of two binary trees <code>p</code> and <code>q</code>, write a function to check if they are the same or not using <code>breadth-first-traversal</code>.</p>

<p>Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
<strong>Output:</strong> true
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="../../../assets/tree/tree-02-ex2.jpg" style="width: 300px;height: 215px;">
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
<strong>Output:</strong> false
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="../../../assets/tree/tree-02-ex3.jpg" style="width: 300px;height: 215px;">
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
<strong>Output:</strong> false
</pre>



## Instruction:

### Language: `JavaScript`:

* Create a branch called `tree_breadth-first`.
* Run this command to pull the code challenge question: `npm run pull-challenge tree 02`
* Navigate to the challenge folder: `code-challenges/tree/challenge02`
* Write your solution in `challenge02.js` file.
* Write your tests in `challenges02.test.js` file.
* Document your work along with an image of your whiteboard in the `whiteboard.md` file.
* To run your test: `npm test`


## Language: `Python`:

* Create a branch called `tree_breadth-first`.
* Run this command to pull the code challenge question: `python pull.py tree 02`
* Navigate to the challenge folder: `code_challenges/tree/challenge02`
* Write your solution in `challenge02.py` file.
* Write your tests in `test_challenges02.py` file.
* Document your work along with an image of your whiteboard in the `whiteboard.md` file.
* To run your test: `pytest`


## Submission:
* ACP your work once you are done.
* Create a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch
* Copy the link to your open pull request and paste it into the assignment submission field.
* Leave a description of how long this assignment took you in the comments box.
* Add any additional comments to your grader about your process or any difficulties you may have had with the assignment.
* Merge your branch into main, and delete your branch (don't worry, the PR link will still work).
